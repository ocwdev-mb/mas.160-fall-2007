description: Supplement to a problem set on simple psychoacoustic masking, Markoff
  processes, entropy, and grading, entropy coding, error correction, and data compression.
  This MATLAB code performs a simple psychoacoustic masking test by creating bandlimited
  noise around 1000 Hz and a single sinusoid at frequency f with amplitude A. It then
  plays the noise alone, and then the noise plus the sinusoid.
